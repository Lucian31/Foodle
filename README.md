# Recipe finder based on a single ingredient.

You happen to be in the kitchen, not knowing what else to cook. By finding a single ingredient, you may find that you have dozens of possible dishes at your fingertips. All you have to do is enter the ingredient in the search box and GO FOOD!

# How this works

This projects helped me to understand better how to work with API's, and practice more JS. So, this website takes as an input a word, wich can be either in english either in romanian. The program checks if it's romanian and convert it in english using DeepL's API, and if is not in romanian, it just go further. Next, the program search that specific keyword into the 'www.themealdb.com' database, wich is accessed with their API,  then I manipulate the JSON code recivied to display the recepies for that specific keyword.

# Warning, it might not work properly know because my deepL token for their API has expired, if you really want to see how it works, just contact me!
